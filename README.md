## Project Description
The first step in this project was data collection. I leveraged the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) library to collect data from Reddit's exposed API they have for developers. I chose to collect information from [r/politcs](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/). After the data was collected, I processed the data so that it could be stored in a Pandas dataframe.
